# CSG.jl

**Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)** is a modeling technique that uses boolean operations like union and intersection to combine 3D solids. This library implements CSG operations on using BSP trees.

It's ported from the excellent javascript library [csg.js](https://evanw.github.io/csg.js/docs/) with some added features (like volume calculation).
